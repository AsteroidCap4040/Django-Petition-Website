# VoiceWave-Petition-Website using Django Framework
This was my very first project during my bachelor’s degree. Looking back, I’m glad I completed it and learned a lot along the way, but I’ll admit the project structure and certain aspects are… let’s say a little rough around the edges.

During testing, I ran into several issues like:

🐞 Random bugs popping up

🔑 Open API keys

🌱 No proper environment setup

…and more

blah blah the list goes on (Damn i taught website is just HTML/CSS/JavaScript and magic).But nevermind as long i can see and interact with result i won't tamper with code.

The project took me a long time, with plenty of trial-and-error and outside help. Revamping the entire codebase now feels overwhelming, so instead I’m only pushing the frontend folder (which I’m oddly proud of 😅). Along with that, I’ll be sharing the project timeline and screenshots to capture the journey.
